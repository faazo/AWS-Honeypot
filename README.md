# AWS-Honeypot-Analysis

This repo contains a high-level, basic example of utilizing Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and data/statistical models for research purposes. This was designed to address 2 prompts:
1) To present information in a way that others can learn from and develop models of their own
2) To identify and predict malicious actors' tendencies based on AWS honeypot data from 2013
